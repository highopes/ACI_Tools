"""
An example of setting an interface back into service on an ACI
fabric node by posting directly to the node rather than to the
APIC.
Note:  If the APIC still has the config to set the interface to
blacklisted, this task will run but then it will be overruled by
the APIC and the interface will go back down.  Fix the APIC
config before running.
